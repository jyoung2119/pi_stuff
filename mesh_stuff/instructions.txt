Run hnamechange.sh like this "sh hnamechange.sh <newhostname>"
Then run nodesetup.sh (If pi is intended to be a gateway, do not shut down)
  If intended to be ethernet gateway, run gatewaysetup.sh. If WiFi gateway, run wifigateway.sh.
    Shutdown gateway
Run "ifconfig" on command line on the gateway pi
  You should see all the interfaces on your gateway pi
Run "iwconfig" to show the wireless interfaces on the device
Run "sudo batctl if" to show the interfaces participating in the mesh
  You should see response "wlan0: active" to show that the WiFi interface wlan0 is part of the mesh
Run "sudo batctl n" to show the neighbouring mesh nodes your gateway node can see
  You should see the mac addresses of the contributing nodes
